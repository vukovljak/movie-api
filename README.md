Web Page created using API

For this project I used API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ .
I only used JavaScript! 
.
On the home page it displays Most Popular Movies/Upcoming Movies...etc

You can search for particular movie in searchbox.

Once you hit the 'Show More' button it will display informations about that movie in modal. In the modal you'll see short description/overview and trailer for that movie.
I used jQuery for just one line in the code. (for stopping video once I close the modal).
It's responsive.
