Web Page created using API

For this project I used API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ .

On the home page it displays Most Popular Movies/Upcoming Movies...etc

You can search for particular movie in searchbox.

Once you hit the 'Show More' button it will display informations about that movie in modal. In the modal you'll see short description/overview and trailer for that movie.

It's responsive.

Feel free to check it out:
